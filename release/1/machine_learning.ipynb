Or the `min_samples_leaf` that sets the minimum amount of data points you have in each leaf. All 3 parameters are dependent on the number of data points in your dataset especially the last 2 so don't forget to adapt them if you have been playing around with a small subset of the data. (A good trick to solve this might be to use a range similar to `[0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1] * len(x_train)`. Feel free to extend the range in any direction. It is generally good practice to construct them using a log scale like in the example, or better like this: `10.0**np.arange(-5, 0, 0.5) * len(x_train)`.) In my experience `min_samples_split` or `min_samples_leaf` give slightly better results and it ususally doesn't make sense to combine more than 1 of these parameters.\n",

What you should do instead is to optimize and select your model using a validation set and of course you should automate this proces as shown in one of the earlier exercises. One thing to take into account here is that you should use multiple initialisation of a random forest because the decision trees is randomly generated."

    "* This noise level of `RidgeCV()` and `LassoCV()` is estimated by automatically performing train and validation within the method itself. This will make them much more robust against over-fitting. The actual method used is [Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) which is a better approach of what we do here because it repeats the training and validation multiple times for different training and validation sets. The parameter that is set for these methods is often called the regularization parameter in literature and is well suited to avoid over-fitting."

    "# 8. Main take home messages\n",

    "Because we can't cover everything, we listed all the basics of what you should take home before working on your own machine learning project below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 The basic rules of machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Any good club has its own set of rules. The rules for machine learning club are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First rule of ML is: Over-fitting is a real problem and try anything to avoid it\n",
    "* Second rule of ML is: You are probably over-fitting. Are you sure you are not fitting on your test data?\n",
    "* Third rule of ML is: You think over-fitting will not happen to you, but it is happening right now!\n",
    "* Fourth rule of ML is: Talk about it with your peers because over-fitting is a real issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 My winning strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I'd like to claim it as mine, it is a general (non-written) consensus amongst data scientists to use the following approach. Even experts should not skip any of the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a train set and a test set\n",
    "* Rescale your train set to zero-mean-unit-variance (most methods assume gaussian distributed data)\n",
    "* Don't look at the test set\n",
    "* Implement a cross-validation framework\n",
    "* Try **linear regression with regularisation** for regression and classification (`RidgeCV` or `LassoCV`)\n",
    "* Try techniques to avoid over-fitting\n",
    "* Check the validation score\n",
    "* If the results are not optimal and there is no overfitting going on try **adding features** else go to step 17\n",
    "* Rescale your features to zero-mean-unit-variance (most methods assume gaussian distributed data) or select those features that have this property\n",
    "* Try techniques to avoid over-fitting (including removing features for more info see [feature selection techniques](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html))\n",
    "* Check the validation score\n",
    "* If the results are not optimal and there is no overfitting going on try **random forrests** else go to step 17\n",
    "* Try techniques to avoid over-fitting (such as feature selection, to rank the features you can use [this approach](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html))\n",
    "* Check the validation score\n",
    "* If the results are not optimal and there is no overfitting going on try **neural networks** or deep learning else go to step 17\n",
    "* Try techniques to avoid over-fitting\n",
    "* Only in the end check the score on the test set and make sure it is similar to the validation score. Otherwise you have been overfitting and you need to take a couple steps back.\n",
    "* Make an ensemble of your best (but significantly different) methods\n",
    "* Finally build the model using all the data available and run it in production\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try other machine learning techniques, but usually the difference is quite small. So don't waste too much time on getting to know them because they all have their own quirks and specific ways of over-fitting. Besides maybe most important of all, Kaggle competitions are usually won with one of these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do want to dive into other methods or if you want more details on the methods discussed here the [sklearn website](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a goot starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3 How to avoid over-fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "As you should know by now over-fitting is one of the biggest issues in machine learning. So pay attention for it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can find some of the most common techniques to avoid over-fitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use more data\n",
    "* Artificially generate more data based on the original data\n",
    "* Use a smaller model (with less parameters)\n",
    "* Use less features (and thus less parameters)\n",
    "* Use a regularisation parameter\n",
    "* Artificially add noise to your model (can be random noise or can be on/of noise in neural networks so that you get dropout)\n",
    "* Only use linear models (or in neural networks make sure that the non-linearity in your model is closer to a linear function)\n",
    "* Combine multiple models that each over-fit in their own peculiar way into what is called an ensemble\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.4 Most common features\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is no general rule to which features you should use, there are a couple of features that come back regularly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Log: Take the log of the data to make it more Gaussian. This works best for data that is exponentially or log-normally distributed\n",
    "* Polynomials: The square is quite common but higher orders are often used as well\n",
    "* Differentials: The first and sometimes the second derivative are used (see [`numpy.diff()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.diff.html))\n",
    "* Integrals (use [`numpy.sum()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html) for example to implement it)\n",
    "* Mean: Often used to smooth the data\n",
    "* Median: Same as the mean but this ignores outliers\n",
    "* Standard deviation or variance\n",
    "* Skewness and kurtosis: These are rarely used but sometimes they contain valuable information\n",
    "* Fourier transform: If your data contains a frequency spectrum. Typically used when processing speech and sound. (see [`numpy.fft.fft()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.fft.fft.html#numpy.fft.fft))\n",
    "* Frequency filtering: Similar to the fourier transform (see [`scipy.signal.butter()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.signal.butter.html#scipy.signal.butter))\n",
    "* Spatial filters: Are often used for images. Edge detectors for example\n",
    "* Any other feature that seems to make sense regarding your data\n",
