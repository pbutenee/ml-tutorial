    "\n",
    "This tutorial consists of 3 parts, the first one will introduce you to Jupyter notebooks and Numpy to get you started with Python. The second part covers the basics of machine learning and the third shows how to build a recommendation engine. Finally, there is a bonus part on time series anomaly detection. Click on the links below to get started!\n",
